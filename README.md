WIP Engine, aboslutely doesnt work yet and breaks at literally every turn

If you want to build on Windows, change the directory to gbdk bin to where you have it installed and then run it.

For linux, edit CC in Makefile to be directed to the location of your gbdk bin location, and then just run make.sh
